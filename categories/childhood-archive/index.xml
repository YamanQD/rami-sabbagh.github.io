I have uploaded various development videos to Youtube to see what I have done, And then created a playlist for them, There are 3 new videos and an old one motioned in the old post.
That was a lot of hard work to make it with clean, simple GUI !
Things have been done: Clean, simple GUI Code drawn grid Quick object select bar New,Save and Load buttons Infinite maps Zoom In/Out with mouse scroll Snap-To-Grid object creation Static Rectangle Soft ball to play with Object options for customization of their properties Custom error screen with bug reports Level System API Things to be done for the demo: Ability to delete objects Level spawn Connected levels system Rectangles color option Player customization Test mode Main menu Add music/sounds to the game</description></item><item><title>Skipping the prototype stage!</title><link>https://rami-sabbagh.github.io/posts/2015-06-18-skipping-the-prototype-stage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rami-sabbagh.github.io/posts/2015-06-18-skipping-the-prototype-stage/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I haven‚Äôt been active for some time, But now i‚Äôm back :)
After some upgrades and rewriting some files, The engine of the game is now able to jump over the prototype stage, Because of that I‚Äôm afraid, I have to pass on it :(
Before I decided to pass on prototype stage, I had some work done on the sandbox (not and won‚Äôt be complete) which you can see in the featured video.</description></item><item><title>PixelizerBox V0.1.3.0 Update (Modding Support)</title><link>https://rami-sabbagh.github.io/posts/2015-05-20-pixelizerbox-v0-1-3-0-update-modding-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rami-sabbagh.github.io/posts/2015-05-20-pixelizerbox-v0-1-3-0-update-modding-support/</guid><description>Hi Everyone, Today I pushed the first update after a long time :D
