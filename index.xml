It has been a long time ago since the last post, Thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m being so busy programming the level editor.
I have uploaded various development videos to Youtube to see what I have done, And then created a playlist for them, There are 3 new videos and an old one motioned in the old post.</description></item><item><title>Skipping the prototype stage!</title><link>https://rami-sabbagh.github.io/posts/2015-06-18-skipping-the-prototype-stage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rami-sabbagh.github.io/posts/2015-06-18-skipping-the-prototype-stage/</guid><description>âš  Important: This is a post from the childhood archive which is written back in 2015, when I was ~14 years old (an 8th grade student).
